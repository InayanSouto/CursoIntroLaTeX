./docs/capitulo2.tex:653: Argument of \@footnotetext has an extra }.
<inserted text>

l.653 \end{texexptitled}
                        
I've run across a `}' that doesn't seem to match anything.
For example, `\def\a#1{...}' and `\a}' would produce
this error. If you simply proceed now, the `\par' that
I've just inserted will cause me to report a runaway
argument that might be the root of the problem. But if
your `}' was spurious, just type `2' and it will go away.

Runaway argument?
./docs/capitulo2.tex:653: Paragraph ended before \@footnotetext was complete.
<to be read again> 
                   \par 
l.653 \end{texexptitled}
                        
I suspect you've forgotten a `}', causing me to apply this
control sequence to too much text. How can we recover?
My plan is to forget the whole thing and hope for the best.
