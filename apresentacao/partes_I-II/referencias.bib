    abstract = {Abstract: The Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) Version-2 Monthly Precipitation Analysis is described. This globally complete, monthly analysis of surface precipitation at 2.5° latitude × 2.5° longitude resolution is available from January 1979 to the present. It is a merged analysis that incorporates precipitation estimates from low-orbit satellite microwave data, geosynchronous-orbit satellite infrared data, and surface rain gauge observations. The merging approach utilizes the higher accuracy of the low-orbit microwave observations to calibrate, or adjust, the more frequent geosynchronous infrared observations. The dataset is extended back into the premicrowave era (before mid-1987) by using infrared-only observations calibrated to the microwave-based analysis of the later years. The combined satellite-based product is adjusted by the rain gauge analysis. The dataset archive also contains the individual input fields, a combined satellite estimate, and error estimates for each field. This monthly analysis is the foundation for the GPCP suite of products, including those at finer temporal resolution. The 23-yr GPCP climatology is characterized, along with time and space variations of precipitation.}

    abstract = {Abstract: Current operational ensemble prediction systems (EPSs) are designed specifically for medium-range forecasting, but there is also considerable interest in predictability in the short range, particularly for potential severe-weather developments. A possible option is to use a poor man’s ensemble prediction system (PEPS) comprising output from different numerical weather prediction (NWP) centers. By making use of a range of different models and independent analyses, a PEPS provides essentially a random sampling of both the initial condition and model evolution errors. In this paper the authors investigate the ability of a PEPS using up to 14 models from nine operational NWP centers. The ensemble forecasts are verified for a 101-day period and five variables: mean sea level pressure, 500-hPa geopotential height, temperature at 850 hPa, 2-m temperature, and 10-m wind speed. Results are compared with the operational ECMWF EPS, using the ECMWF analysis as the verifying “truth.” It is shown that, despite its smaller size, PEPS is an efficient way of producing ensemble forecasts and can provide competitive performance in the short range. The best relative performance is found to come from hybrid configurations combining output from a small subset of the ECMWF EPS with other different NWP models.}

    abstract = {Abstract: Numerical models of ocean circulation are subject to systematic errors resulting from errors in model physics, numerics, inaccurately specified initial conditions, and errors in surface forcing. In addition to a time-mean component, the systematic errors include components that are time varying, which could result, for example, from inaccuracies in the time-varying forcing. Despite their importance, most assimilation algorithms incorrectly assume that the forecast model is unbiased. In this paper the authors characterize the bias for a current assimilation scheme in the tropical Pacific. The characterization is used to show how relatively simple empirical bias forecast models may be used in a two-stage bias correction procedure to improve the quality of the analysis.}

It is an integral part of the automatic data processing system, and is designed to operate with a minimum of manual supervision. The analysis method, based mainly on the method of Bergthórssen and Dööos, is essentially a method of applying corrections to a first guess field. The corrections are determined from a comparison of the data with the interpolated value of the guess field at the observation point. For the analysis of the heights of a pressure surface the reported wind is taken into account in determining the lateral gradient of the correction to be applied. A series of scans of the field is made, each scan consisting of application of corrections on a smaller lateral scale than during the previous scan. The analysis system is very flexible, and has been used to analyze many different types of variables. An example of horizontal divergence computed from a direct wind analysis is shown.}

    abstract={Abstract: In this note, it is discussed how a coordinate transformation based on semigeostrophic theory can be introduced in a global data assimilation scheme in order to improve the analysis of frontal structures. An expression of the coordinate change on the sphere is proposed and an iterative procedure is defined to perform this transformation. This algorithm also includes an iterative filtering of the wind field used for the coordinate change. This filtering is equivalent to a filtering of the wind in the transformed space that nearly keeps unchanged the corresponding high cyclonic vorticity values in physical space associated with cold fronts. It is shown that the transformation can be built for a real meteorological case. The main impact of this transformation in the framework of data assimilation is that it enables the use of anisotropic forecast correlations that are flow dependent. As expected, the correlations in the vicinity of a front are found to be contracted in the horizontal but also vertically tilted.}

    abstract = {Abstract: A poor man's ensemble is a set of independent numerical weather prediction (NWP) model forecasts from several operational centers. Because it samples uncertainties in both the initial conditions and model formulation through the variation of input data, analysis, and forecast methodologies of its component members, it is less prone to systematic biases and errors that cause underdispersive behavior in single-model ensemble prediction systems (EPSs). It is also essentially cost-free. Its main disadvantage is its relatively small size. This paper investigates the ability of a poor man's ensemble to provide forecasts of the probability and distribution of rainfall in the short range, 1–2 days. The poor man's ensemble described here consists of 24- and 48-h daily quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPFs) from seven operational NWP models. The ensemble forecasts were verified for a 28-month period over Australia using gridded daily rain gauge analyses. Forecasts of the probability of precipitation (POP) were skillful for rain rates up to 50 mm day−1 for the first 24-h period, exceeding the skill of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts EPS. Probabilistic skill was limited to lower rain rates during the second 24 h. The skill and accuracy of the ensemble mean QPF far exceeded that of the individual models for both forecast periods when standard measures such as the root-mean-square error and equitable threat score were used. Additional measures based on the forecast location and intensity of individual rain events substantiated the improvements associated with the ensemble mean QPF. The greatest improvement was seen in the location of the forecast rain pattern, as the mean displacement from the observations was reduced by 30\%. As a result the number of event forecasts that could be considered “hits” (forecast rain location and maximum intensity close to the observed) improved markedly. Averaging to produce the ensemble mean caused a large bias in rain area and a corresponding reduction in mean and maximum rain intensity. Several alternative deterministic ensemble forecasts were tested, with the most successful using probability matching to reassign the ensemble mean rain rates using the rain rate distribution of the component QPFs. This eliminated most of the excess rain area and increased the maximum rain rates, improving the event hit rate. The dependence of the POP and ensemble mean results on the number of members included in the ensemble was investigated using the 24-h model QPFs. When ensemble members were selected randomly the performance improved monotonically with increasing ensemble size, with verification statistics approaching their asymptotic limits for an ensemble size of seven. When the members were chosen according to greatest overall skill the ensemble performance peaked when only five or six members were used. This suggests that the addition of ensemble members with lower skill can degrade the overall product. Low values of the spread–skill correlation indicate that it is not possible to predict the forecast skill from the spread of the ensemble alone. However, the number of models predicting a particular rain event gives a good indication of the likelihood of the ensemble to envelop the location and magnitude of that event.}

The EnKF has a large user group, and numerous publications have discussed applications and theoretical aspects of it. This paper reviews the important results from these studies and also presents new ideas and alternative interpretations which further explain the success of the EnKF. In addition to providing the theoretical framework needed for using the EnKF, there is also a focus on the algorithmic formulation and optimal numerical implementation. A program listing is given for some of the key subroutines. The paper also touches upon specific issues such as the use of nonlinear measurements, in situ profiles of temperature and salinity, and data which are available with high frequency in time. An ensemble based optimal interpolation (EnOI) scheme is presented as a cost-effective approach which may serve as an alternative to the EnKF in some applications. A fairly extensive discussion is devoted to the use of time correlated model errors and the estimation of model bias.},

    abstract={Abstract: This article describes the main features of the Brazilian Global Atmospheric Model (BAM), analyses of its performance for tropical rainfall forecasting, and its sensitivity to convective scheme and horizontal resolution. BAM is the new global atmospheric model of the Center for Weather Forecasting and Climate Research [Centro de Previsão de Tempo e Estudos Climáticos (CPTEC)], which includes a new dynamical core and state-of-the-art parameterization schemes. BAM’s dynamical core incorporates a monotonic two-time-level semi-Lagrangian scheme, which is carried out completely on the model grid for the tridimensional transport of moisture, microphysical prognostic variables, and tracers. The performance of the quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPFs) from two convective schemes, the Grell–Dévényi (GD) scheme and its modified version (GDM), and two different horizontal resolutions are evaluated against the daily TRMM Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis over different tropical regions. Three main results are 1) the QPF skill was improved substantially with GDM in comparison to GD; 2) the increase in the horizontal resolution without any ad hoc tuning improves the variance of precipitation over continents with complex orography, such as Africa and South America, whereas over oceans there are no significant differences; and 3) the systematic errors (dry or wet biases) remain virtually unchanged for 5-day forecasts. Despite improvements in the tropical precipitation forecasts, especially over southeastern Brazil, dry biases over the Amazon and La Plata remain in BAM. Improving the precipitation forecasts over these regions remains a challenge for the future development of the model to be used not only for numerical weather prediction over South America but also for global climate simulations.}

    abstract={Abstract: Using a spectral-type cumulus parameterization that includes moist downdrafts within a three-dimensional mesoscale model, various disparate closure assumptions are systematically tested within the generalized framework of dynamic control, static control, and feedback. Only one assumption at a time is changed and tested using a midlatitude environment of severe convection. A control run is presented, which shows good agreement with observations in many aspects. Results of the sensitivity tests are compared to observations in terms of sea level pressure, rainfall patterns, and domain-averaged bias errors (compared to the control run) of various properties. The dynamic control is the part that determines the modulation of the convection by the environment. It is shown that rate of destabilization, as well as instantaneous stability, work well for the dynamic control. Integrated moisture convergence leads to underprediction of rainfall rates and subsequent degrading of the results in terms of movement and structure of the mesoscale convective system (MCS). The feedback determines the modification of the environment by the convection, and in this study is considered together with the static control, which determines cloud properties. All feedback and static-control assumptions tested here seem very important for the prediction of sea level pressure and rainfall. The most crucial ones were downdrafts and lateral mixing. As an interesting by-product, it is shown that a very simplistic and computationally highly efficient convective parameterization scheme leads to a very realistic simulation of the MCS, if the scheme uses a stability closure, assumes a large cloud size, parameterizes moist downdrafts, and does not assume unrealistically law lateral mixing.}

    abstract={Abstract: The results of a local and a nonlocal scheme for vertical diffusion in the atmospheric boundary layer are compared within the context of a global climate model. The global model is an updated version of the NCAR Community Climate Model (CCM2). The local diffusion scheme uses an eddy diffusivity determined independently at each point in the vertical, based on local vertical gradients of wind and virtual potential temperature, similar to the usual approach in global atmospheric models. The nonlocal scheme determines an eddy-diffusivity profile based on a diagnosed boundary-layer height and a turbulent velocity scale. It also incorporates nonlocal (vertical) transport effects for heat and moisture. The two diffusion schemes are summarized, and their results are compared with independent radiosonde observations for a number of locations. The focus herein is on the temperature and humidity structure over ocean, where the surface temperatures are specified, since the boundary-layer scheme interacts strongly with the land-surface parameterization. Systematic differences are shown in global-climate simulations, with CCM2 using the two schemes. The nonlocal scheme transports moisture away from the surface more rapidly than the local scheme, and deposits the moisture at higher levels. The local scheme tends to saturate the lowest model levels unrealistically, which typically leads to clouds too low in the atmosphere. The nonlocal scheme has been chosen for CCM2 because of its more comprehensive representation of the physics of boundary-layer transport in dry convective conditions.}

    abstract = {Abstract: The One-Degree Daily (1DD) technique is described for producing globally complete daily estimates of precipitation on a 1° × 1° lat/long grid from currently available observational data. Where possible (40°N–40°S), the Threshold-Matched Precipitation Index (TMPI) provides precipitation estimates in which the 3-hourly infrared brightness temperatures (IR Tb) are compared with a threshold and all ``cold'' pixels are given a single precipitation rate. This approach is an adaptation of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite Precipitation Index, but for the TMPI the IR Tb threshold and conditional rain rate are set locally by month from Special Sensor Microwave Imager–based precipitation frequency and the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) satellite–gauge (SG) combined monthly precipitation estimate, respectively. At higher latitudes the 1DD features a rescaled daily Television and Infrared Observation Satellite Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) precipitation. The frequency of rain days in the TOVS is scaled down to match that in the TMPI at the data boundaries, and the resulting nonzero TOVS values are scaled locally to sum to the SG (which is a globally complete monthly product). The GPCP has approved the 1DD as an official product, and data have been produced for 1997 through 1999, with production continuing a few months behind real time (to allow access to monthly input data). The time series of the daily 1DD global images shows good continuity in time and across the data boundaries. Various examples are shown to illustrate uses. Validation for individual gridbox values shows a very high mean absolute error, but it improves quickly when users perform time/space averaging according to their own requirements.}

ABSTRACT: The change in vegetation cover has influenced the definition of precipitation regimes in regional and global scale. This study explored the impact of variability of  stored energy in the soil-canopy system and its impact on the definition of precipitation standard in South America. The methodology consists in performing the coupling MCGA-CPTEC/INPE three surface schemes with different degrees of simplification of physical processes parameterizations. To accomplish this coupling has developed a scheme based on the Hostlag and Boville boundary layer model. The results showed that the coupling was successful, and in some respects improve the simulation of the short and long term weather forecasting in South America. It was observed a linear relationship between the variability of precipitation and the stored energy in the soil-canopy system, particularly in regions where there is dense vegetation, and the correlation between these two variables is negative, indicating that there is a negative feedback. With the wavelet transform technique was noted that even in short term weather forecasting has a memory impact of stored energy in the soil-canopy system in the variability of precipitation, this process is mainly related to the type of soil and stored moisture in the soil and canopy. Another form of stored energy analyzed is related to energy generated by biogeochemistry energy generated by photosynthesis during the absorption of CO2 by the plants. The simulation results showed that the carbon flux between the biosphere and the atmosphere (NPP) impacts in the variability of precipitation in the long time scale. For longer time scale, the CO2 fertilization may cause an increase in the net primary production NPP in areas with a lot of water and nutrients. This may force an increase in the leaf area index, increasing the transpiration. This work shows that the stored energy in the soil-canopy system due the water cycle and carbon (soil moisture and NPP) impacts directly or indirectly in the variability of precipitation in South America.},

    abstract = {Abstract: The theoretical skill of Monte Carlo approximations to the stochastic dynamic forecasting technique proposed by Epstein is examined by means of an extension of earlier atmospheric predictability studies that used the test-field model of two-dimensional turbulence. The fundamental statistical hydrodynamical concept of an ensemble of phase paths evolving in a dynamical phase space is reviewed and used to define the statistical properties of a finite Monte Carlo sample. The application of a linear regression step to arrive at a final best estimate of the state of the atmosphere is also discussed. The resulting forecasts approach the climatological mean at forecast times so late that all skill has been lost. For an ideal case with an observing resolution, hopefully achievable in the 1980s with satellite-based sensors, it is found that the. Monte Carlo procedure leads to the greatest improvement in mean-square vector wind forecast skill in the 6- to 10-day range. For another case corresponding roughly to present operational resolution the wind forecast skill is improved considerably in the 2- to 5-day range. Much of the improvement in mean-square skill is a consequence of the optimal filtering nature of the procedure which damps erroneous small scale structure in favor of the more predictable large scales.}

    abstract={Abstract: Turbulence models centered on hypotheses by Rotta and Kolmogoroff are complex. In the present paper we consider systematic simplifications based on the observation that parameters governing the degree of anisotropy are small. Hopefully, we shall discern a level of complexity which is intuitively attractive and which optimizes computational speed and convenience without unduly sacrificing accuracy. Discussion is focused on density stratified flow due to temperature. However, other dependent variables—such as water vapor and droplet density—can be treated in analogous fashion. It is, in fact, the anticipation of additional physical complexity in modeling turbulent flow fields that partially motivates the interest in an organized process of analytical simplification. For the problem of a planetary boundary layer subject to a diurnally varying surface heat flux or surface temperature, three models of varying complexity have been integrated for 10 days. All of the models incorporate identical empirical constants obtained from neutral flow data alone. The most complex of the three models requires simultaneous solution of 10 partial differential equations for turbulence moments in addition to the equations for the mean velocity components and temperature; the least complex eliminates all of the 10 differential equation whereas a “compromise” model retains two differential equations for total turbulent energy and temperature variance. We conclude that all of the models give nearly the same results. We find the two-differential-equation model particularly attractive.}

    abstract="Abstract: This work describes the formulation and climatology of an atmospheric general circulation model (GCM) of intermediate complexity, based on a spectral primitive-equation dynamical core and a set of simplified physical parametrization schemes. The parametrization package has been specially designed to work in models with just a few vertical levels, and is based on the same physical principles adopted in the schemes of state-of-the art GCMs. The parametrized processes include large-scale condensation, convection, clouds, short-wave and long-wave radiation, surface fluxes and vertical diffusion. In the current configuration, the model (nicknamed SPEEDY, from Simplified Parametrizations, primitivE-Equation DYnamics``) has five vertical levels and a spectral truncation at total wave number 30 (T30L5). The top vertical level (crudely) represents the stratosphere, the bottom one the planetary boundary layer. Computationally, SPEEDY requires (at least) one order of magnitude less CPU time than a state-of-the-art GCM at the same horizontal resolution, and is therefore suitable for studies of inter-decadal or inter-centennial variability. Statistics of the model mean state and variability are computed from an ensemble of 41-year simulations forced by observed sea-surface temperatures in the period 1952--1992. The model mean state is closer to the observed climatology during the (boreal) winter than during summer. In winter (i.e. December to February, DJF), the model underestimates the amplitude of the Northern Hemisphere stationary wave pattern, particularly in the European-Atlantic sector. Some aspects of the systematic error of SPEEDY are in fact typical of many GCMs, although the error amplitude is stronger than in state-of-the-art models. On the other hand, the global distribution of precipitation in DJF is quite realistic, and compares well with that of more complex GCMs. In summer (June to August), a strong negative bias in the mid-tropospheric temperature generates a Northern Hemisphere circulation with some springtime characteristics. In particular, the position of the Tropical Convergence Zone in the Indian Ocean remains too far south, leading to a deficient simulation of the monsoon circulation over South Asia. The simulated variability during the northern winter is reasonably realistic as far as the spatial distribution is concerned, although some underestimation in the intensity can be found, particularly in the low-frequency range and in the Atlantic sector. The atmospheric response to ENSO events is also weaker than observed, although the spatial patterns of the rainfall and geopotential response in the Pacific sector are in phase with their observed counterparts. In the Atlantic/Eurasian region, the spatial patterns associated with the interdecadal trends in the simulated and observed large-scale circulation show a clear positive correlation, consistent with the hypothesis of a positive ocean--atmosphere feedback on decadal time scales.",

    abstract={Abstract: Wind and pressure fields are fitted by third-degree polynomials in areas of the order of 106 square miles. Expressions involving derivatives of wind and pressure are computed and the question of computation of geostrophic deviations is re-examined. A method of connecting polynomials in separate areas is investigated. The following conclusions are drawn: Isopleths and streamlines drawn from the polynomials greatly resemble subjective isopleths and streamlines. In all cases studied, the smoothing seems to be adequate. Horizontal divergence and vertical velocities can be determined as well from the polynomials objectively as by other subjective methods. The errors of observation influence the magnitude of these quantities considerably, but usually do not affect the sign. On the scale of these measurements, reliable pressure gradients can be obtained objectively; however, the Laplacian of pressure is very much affected by the technique of analysis and by observational errors. Reliable values of the geostrophic deviations can be obtained only under favorable conditions. Hence any method of integration of the fundamental equations which requires knowledge of the geostrophic deviations is to be avoided.}

Para a obten{\c{c}}{\~a}o da an{\'a}lise, o G3DVAR busca encontrar um estado {\'o}timo que leve em considera{\c{c}}{\~a}o as observa{\c{c}}{\~o}es e as previs{\~o}es de curto prazo do modelo, e seus respectivos erros. A an{\'a}lise dos campos de umidade apresenta em alguns casos valores negativos ou valores de umidade acima do valor de satura{\c{c}}{\~a}o. Essas solu{\c{c}}{\~o}es s{\~a}o puramente num{\'e}ricas e em sua maioria geradas no processo de Assimila{\c{c}}{\~a}o de Dados e na integra{\c{c}}{\~a}o do modelo, ou seja, n{\~a}o correspondem {\`a} realidade f{\'{\i}}sica e precisam ser tratadas durante o processo de minimiza{\c{c}}{\~a}o da fun{\c{c}}{\~a}o custo para que n{\~a}o sejam amplificados. O G3DVAR usa um termo adicional na fun{\c{c}}{\~a}o custo, chamado de injun{\c{c}}{\~a}o de umidade. Este termo tem a fun{\c{c}}{\~a}o de regular o processo de minimiza{\c{c}}{\~a}o, conduzindo a solu{\c{c}}{\~a}o para valores de umidade mais pr{\'o}ximos da realidade f{\'{\i}}sica. No entanto, este processo de regula{\c{c}}{\~a}o depende de par{\^a}metros que controlem a atua{\c{c}}{\~a}o desse termo adicional. Com o objetivo de identificar os valores dos par{\^a}metros da injun{\c{c}}{\~a}o de umidade usados no processo de minimiza{\c{c}}{\~a}o da fun{\c{c}}{\~a}o custo do G3DVAR que melhorem a qualidade da an{\'a}lise e, consequentemente, as previs{\~o}es geradas foram realizados experimentos que variaram o valor desses par{\^a}metros com dados para o m{\^e}s de junho de 2014. A an{\'a}lise dos dados mostrou que os pontos de grade com valores negativos de umidade distribuem-se por toda a atmosfera simulada pelo modelo sobre as altas latitudes do hemisf{\'e}rio sul e tendem a se distribuir em dire{\c{c}}{\~a}o as baixas latitudes quando o valor dos par{\^a}metros de injun{\c{c}}{\~a}o aumenta. ABSTRACT: The G3DVAR assimilation system, based in the Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI), coupled to Atmospheric General Circulation Model (AGCM), is an initiative of CPTEC/INPE (Center for Weather Forecast and Climate Studies) in generate an initial condition that takes into account the model balances and, consequently, be one that also fosters the obtainment of the best forecasts with emphasis on the South America. To obtain the analysis, G3DVAR looks for a great condition that takes into account the observations and short-term forecasts of the model, beyond their errors. The analysis of the humidity fields presents in some cases negative values and humidity values above the saturation value. These solutions are purely numerical and mostly generated in the process of data assimilation and model integration, that is, they don´t correspond at the physical reality and need to be treated during the process of minimizing of the cost function so that they doesnt be amplified. G3DVAR uses an additional term in the cost function, called moisture constraint. This term has the function of regulate the process of minimizing, taking the solution to humidity values closer to the physical reality. However, this regulation process depends of parameters that control the acting of this additional term. Aiming to identify the values of the moisture constraint parameters used in the process of minimizing of the G3DVAR cost function, that improve the analysis quality and, consequently, the generated forecasts, were realized experiments that varied the value of these parameters, in the month June 2014. The data analysis showed that the grid points with negative humidity values are distributed throughout the atmosphere simulated in the model over the high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere and tend to spread toward the low latitudes where the value of moisture constraint parameters increases.},

    abstract = {Abstract: This study aims at the theoretical development of a method of “four-dimensional analysis,” namely the numerical variational analysis. The three basic types of variational formalism in the numerical variational analysis method are discussed. The basic formalisms are categorized into three areas: (1) “timewise localized” formalism, (2) formalism with strong constraint, and (3) formalism with weak constraint. Exact satisfaction of selected prognostic equations were formulated as constraints in the functionals for the first two formalisms. However, only the second formalism contains explicitly the time variation terms in the Euler equations. The third formalism is characterized by the subsidiary condition which requires that the prognostic or diagnostic equations must be approximately satisfied. The variational formalisms and the associated Euler-Lagrange equations are obtained in the form of finite-difference analogs. In this article, the filtering of cach formalism and the uniqueness of solutions of the Euler equations are discussed for a limit that time and space increments (Δt and Δx) approach zero. The results from the limited case study can be applied, with some modification, for the cases where these increments are finite. In addition, a numerical method of solving the Euler equations is discussed. The discussion is facilitated, merely for the sake of simplicity, by choosing a linear advection equation as a dynamical constraint. However, the discussion can be applied to more complicated and realistic cases.}

    abstract={Abstract: The formulation of a revised land surface parameterization for use within atmospheric general circulation models (GCMs) is presented. The model (SiB2) incorporates several significant improvements over the first version of the Simple Biosphere model (SiB) described in Sellers et al. The improvements can be summarized as follows: (i) incorporation of a realistic canopy photosynthesis–conductance model to describe the simultaneous transfer of CO2 and water vapor into and out of the vegetation, respectively; (ii) use of satellite data, as described in a companion paper, Part II, to describe the vegetation phonology; (iii) modification of the hydrological submodel to give better descriptions of baseflows and a more reliable calculation of interlayer exchanges within the soil profile; (iv) incorporation of a “patchy” snowmelt treatment, which prevents rapid thermal and surface reflectance transitions when the area-averaged snow cover is low and decreasing. To accommodate the changes in (i) and (ii) above, the original two-layer vegetation canopy structure of SiB2 has been reduced to a single layer in SiB2. The use of satellite data in SiB2 and the performance of SiB2 when coupled to a GCM are described in the two companion papers, Part II and III.}

The objective of this work is to verify wether or not the deep convection parametrization scheme impact on data assimilation system of the Global Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (GLETKF). The GLETKF is the Kalman Filter combined with Spectral Atmospheric Global Circulation Model (AGCM). The global model with T126L28 resolution and the convective schemes Kuo and Grell were used. The results are evaluated comparing with the analysis proceeding from the National Center for Environmental Prediction - NCEP. The results have shown that the choice of the scheme of deep convection in the CPTEC AGCM affects the analysis. The Grell scheme in comparison of Kuo scheme reduced significatively the quadratic average error in the geopotencial height fields over South America at medium and high levels (500 hPa and 250 hPa).},

    abstract={Abstract: Ensemble data assimilation methods assimilate observations using state-space estimation methods and low-rank representations of forecast and analysis error covariances. A key element of such methods is the transformation of the forecast ensemble into an analysis ensemble with appropriate statistics. This transformation may be performed stochastically by treating observations as random variables, or deterministically by requiring that the updated analysis perturbations satisfy the Kalman filter analysis error covariance equation. Deterministic analysis ensemble updates are implementations of Kalman square root filters. The nonuniqueness of the deterministic transformation used in square root Kalman filters provides a framework to compare three recently proposed ensemble data assimilation methods.}

    abstract={Abstract: A hybrid analysis scheme is compared with an ensemble square root filter (EnSRF) analysis scheme in the presence of model errors as a follow-up to a previous perfect-model comparison. In the hybrid scheme, the ensemble perturbations are updated by the ensemble transform Kalman filter (ETKF) and the ensemble mean is updated with a hybrid ensemble and static background-error covariance. The experiments were conducted with a two-layer primitive equation model. The true state was a T127 simulation. Data assimilation experiments were conducted at T31 resolution (3168 complex spectral coefficients), assimilating imperfect observations drawn from the T127 nature run. By design, the magnitude of the truncation error was large, which provided a test on the ability of both schemes to deal with model error. Additive noise was used to parameterize model errors in the background ensemble for both schemes. In the first set of experiments, additive noise was drawn from a large inventory of historical forecast errors; in the second set of experiments, additive noise was drawn from a large inventory of differences between forecasts and analyses. The static covariance was computed correspondingly from the two inventories. The hybrid analysis was statistically significantly more accurate than the EnSRF analysis. The improvement of the hybrid over the EnSRF was smaller when differences of forecasts and analyses were used to form the random noise and the static covariance. The EnSRF analysis was more sensitive to the size of the ensemble than the hybrid. A series of tests was conducted to understand why the EnSRF performed worse than the hybrid. It was shown that the inferior performance of the EnSRF was likely due to the sampling error in the estimation of the model-error covariance in the mean update and the less-balanced EnSRF initial conditions resulting from the extra localizations used in the EnSRF.}

    abstract={Abstract: An ensemble Kalman filter-variational hybrid data assimilation system based on the gridpoint statistical interpolation (GSI) three-dimensional variational data assimilation (3DVar) system was developed. The performance of the system was investigated using the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast System model. Experiments covered a 6-week Northern Hemisphere winter period. Both the control and ensemble forecasts were run at the same, reduced resolution. Operational conventional and satellite observations along with an 80-member ensemble were used. Various configurations of the system including one- or two-way couplings, with zero or nonzero weights on the static covariance, were intercompared and compared with the GSI 3DVar system. It was found that the hybrid system produced more skillful forecasts than the GSI 3DVar system. The inclusion of a static component in the background-error covariance and recentering the analysis ensemble around the variational analysis did not improve the forecast skill beyond the one-way coupled system with zero weights on the static covariance. The one-way coupled system with zero static covariances produced more skillful wind forecasts averaged over the globe than the EnKF at the 1-5-day lead times and more skillful temperature forecasts than the EnKF at the 5-day lead time. Sensitivity tests indicated that the difference may be due to the use of the tangent linear normal mode constraint in the variational system. For the first outer loop, the hybrid system showed a slightly slower (faster) convergence rate at early (later) iterations than the GSI 3DVar system. For the second outer loop, the hybrid system showed a faster convergence.}

    abstract={Abstract: The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is a data assimilation scheme based on the traditional Kalman filter update equation. An ensemble of forecasts are used to estimate the background-error covariances needed to compute the Kalman gain. It is known that if the same observations and the same gain are used to update each member of the ensemble, the ensemble will systematically underestimate analysis-error covariances. This will cause a degradation of subsequent analyses and may lead to filter divergence. For large ensembles, it is known that this problem can be alleviated by treating the observations as random variables, adding random perturbations to them with the correct statistics. Two important consequences of sampling error in the estimate of analysis-error covariances in the EnKF are discussed here. The first results from the analysis-error covariance being a nonlinear function of the background-error covariance in the Kalman filter. Due to this nonlinearity, analysis-error covariance estimates may be negatively biased, even if the ensemble background-error covariance estimates are unbiased. This problem must be dealt with in any Kalman filter–based ensemble data assimilation scheme. A second consequence of sampling error is particular to schemes like the EnKF that use perturbed observations. While this procedure gives asymptotically correct analysis-error covariance estimates for large ensembles, the addition of perturbed observations adds an additional source of sampling error related to the estimation of the observation-error covariances. In addition to reducing the accuracy of the analysis-error covariance estimate, this extra source of sampling error increases the probability that the analysis-error covariance will be underestimated. Because of this, ensemble data assimilation methods that use perturbed observations are expected to be less accurate than those which do not. Several ensemble filter formulations have recently been proposed that do not require perturbed observations. This study examines a particularly simple implementation called the ensemble square root filter, or EnSRF. The EnSRF uses the traditional Kalman gain for updating the ensemble mean but uses a “reduced” Kalman gain to update deviations from the ensemble mean. There is no additional computational cost incurred by the EnSRF relative to the EnKF when the observations have independent errors and are processed one at a time. Using a hierarchy of perfect model assimilation experiments, it is demonstrated that the elimination of the sampling error associated with the perturbed observations makes the EnSRF more accurate than the EnKF for the same ensemble size.}

    abstract = {Abstract: This study illustrates the capability of the ensemble technique to improve hurricane forecasts in the Florida State University Global Spectral Model. A perturbation method for hurricane ensemble prediction is proposed. The perturbation method consists of perturbing hurricane initial position and the large-scale environment in which the storm is embedded. The position perturbation is done by displacing the observed hurricane toward different directions by a small distance. The empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis is used to find fast-growing modes in the initial state. It is shown that the model forecasts, in terms of both hurricane track and other physical variables, are very sensitive to the hurricane initial position, intensity, and its large-scale environment. The results also show the EOF-based perturbations are the fast-growing modes and can be used to reduce the initial uncertainty in the analysis. The hurricane forecast obtained from ensemble statistics lead to a large improvement in the track forecasts. For the intensity forecasts, the ensemble prediction provides several statistical methods to display the forecasts. The statistical mean from individual ensemble members provide an overview of the forecast. The spatial distribution of the probability of predicted variables make it possible to find the most likely weather pattern.}
